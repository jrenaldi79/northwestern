          "Hands-on builder. Not someone who \"used to code.\" Someone who builds production AI systems today. The tools are changing too fast for secondhand knowledge. Students need an instructor who has shipped MCP servers, built agentic systems, and debugged LLM pipelines this month.",
          "Startup experience. Someone who has founded a company, raised capital, and exited. Entrepreneurship cannot be taught from case studies alone. Students benefit from someone who has lived the fundraising pitch, the pivot, the acquisition negotiation.",
          "This matters more now than ever. AI has collapsed the cost of building, but it has not changed the hard parts: figuring out what to build, finding customers who will pay, navigating ambiguity with limited resources. Founders learn these skills through survival, not textbooks. They have shipped products when the plan fell apart, pivoted when the market said no, and made decisions with incomplete information under pressure. In an era where anyone can prompt an AI to generate code, the differentiating skills are exactly what founders develop: judgment about what's worth building, speed of iteration, and the ability to operate when the path is not clear. A founder who has exited brings something an academic or career corporate employee cannot: the full lifecycle perspective from idea to acquisition, and the scar tissue that comes with it.",
          "Design fluency. The Product Engineer role sits at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. The instructor should have led UX and design teams, not just collaborated with them. They should understand what makes products feel right, not just function correctly.",
          "Industry connectivity. Someone embedded in the startup and venture ecosystem who sees where the industry is heading before it becomes mainstream. Curriculum needs to reflect what employers will want in 2-3 years, not what they wanted when the textbook was written.",
          "Industry connectivity also means access. The right instructor can bring their network directly into the classroom: founders who just raised Series A, CTOs navigating AI adoption at scale, VCs evaluating the next wave of startups. These are not theoretical conversations. Students hear from practitioners living this shift in real-time. Guest speakers become mentors. Class discussions become recruiting conversations. The instructor's network becomes the students' network. This transforms a course from content delivery into a bridge between McCormick and the companies students want to join.",
          "Teaching experience. Someone who has already taught at the graduate level across engineering and business schools, and who has trained corporate teams from entry-level to executive.",

      "I am an unusual combination: a Google executive who still ships code, a founder with a nine-figure exit, and a design leader who has led UXR, UI/UX, and engineering teams. I have held VP and General Manager responsibilities at Google and Motorola. I co-founded Jiobit, a wearable tech startup acquired by Life360 (NASDAQ: LIF) in 2021. I operate fluently across executive strategy and hands-on building. My consulting clients range from C-suite executives to senior engineers. My corporate workshops serve entry-level engineers through product directors. I teach MBAs at Kellogg and engineers at McCormick. I serve on AI advisory boards for Menlo Ventures and Techstars. This range is rare."

I build multi-agent systems using LangChain, n8n, and ReAct frameworks that coordinate across foundational models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere). I have built systems that stream real-time meeting transcripts via Websockets and Assembly AI, enabling agents to act during live calls.",
          "Full-Stack AI Infrastructure: I work across the modern AI stack: vector databases (PGVector), semantic search with embeddings, full-text search (BM25), Cohere reranking, Agentic RAG pipelines, and LLM chaining with reflection loops. I build in React/TypeScript with serverless APIs and integrate tools like Firecrawl and Tavily for deep research agents. I have built browser automation agents, content graders with scoring rubrics, and custom HTML email generation systems.",
          "Live Multimodal AI: I build systems that process voice, text, and images in real-time, connecting AI agents to device hardware and sensor data.",
          "Synthetic User Platforms: I built a synthetic user system that simulates customer feedback using LLM-generated personas. The platform uses graph databases and knowledge graphs to model user relationships and context, with self-learning loops that refine persona accuracy based on research validation. This is an example of the new AI workflows reshaping product development.",
          "Agentic Procedural Memory: I designed and built an Agentic Procedural Memory System that enables AI agents to learn from their own experiences. The system detects failure-to-success patterns in tool usage, performs automated root cause analysis, and stores reusable procedures in a hybrid search architecture (vector embeddings + BM25 full-text search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion). Agents using this system show 50% step reduction and 95%+ success rates on similar tasks. This work builds directly on recent research from Zhejiang University and Alibaba.",
          "Client Work & Executive Advisory: I consult directly with public company CTOs and CEOs on AI strategy, and run hands-on design workshops with their development teams.

A recent investigation reverse-engineered Claude Code's API requests and identified an implementation flaw: skill instructions were being injected as user messages (low authority) rather than in the system prompt (high authority), explaining why Vercel's benchmarks showed only 53% pass rates. This kind of deep technical analysis is what I bring to both clients and students.",
