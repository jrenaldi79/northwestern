Designers, product managers, and engineers are moving toward each other—and AI tools are accelerating the convergence.\n\n-   **PMs → Engineers:** Six months ago, most product managers shipped zero code. Today, most PMs ship at least one pull request per month. At Anthropic, PMs ship features directly. By end of 2026, PMs may write 10-20% of production code.\n\n-   **Designers → Engineers & PMs:** Designers no longer hand off static mockups. With AI tools, they prototype in production code, make product decisions in real-time, and understand the systems they design for.\n\n-   **Engineers → Product:** When implementation becomes easy, the valuable skill becomes knowing what to build. Engineers who understand customer problems, market dynamics, and business models are worth more than those who only execute specs.\n\n<!-- @convergence -->\n<!-- @role from=\"PMs\" to=\"Engineering\" description=\"Today, most PMs ship at least one pull request per month.

These tools do not replace judgment. They automate the translation layer between idea and implementation. The role that remains is the one who knows what to build and why.\n\n| Traditional Workflow | AI-Augmented Workflow |\n|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Designer creates mockups → hands off to engineer | Designer prototypes in production code directly |\n| PM writes specs → waits for implementation | PM ships features, describes intent to AI |\n| Engineer translates requirements to code | Engineer orchestrates AI agents, focuses on architecture |\n| Research takes weeks (recruiting, interviews, analysis) | AI extracts themes in minutes from transcripts |\n| Prototyping requires coding skills | Anyone can describe and generate working prototypes |\n\n**Synthetic users** represent another shift: AI personas that simulate customer feedback before a single line of code is written. Product teams can now test positioning, validate assumptions, and iterate on concepts using LLM-generated personas trained on real research data. This changes the research-to-build cycle entirely.\n\nAI lowers the floor to coding while raising the ceiling for engineering.

The tools are changing too fast for secondhand knowledge. Students need an instructor who has shipped MCP servers, built agentic systems, and debugged LLM pipelines this month.\n\n**Startup experience.** Someone who has founded a company, raised capital, and exited. Entrepreneurship cannot be taught from case studies alone.\n\nThis matters more now than ever. AI has collapsed the cost of building, but not the hard parts: figuring out what to build, finding customers who will pay, navigating ambiguity with limited resources. Founders learn these skills through survival. In an era where anyone can prompt an AI to generate code, the differentiating skills are exactly what founders develop: judgment about what's worth building, speed of iteration, and the ability to operate when the path is unclear. A founder who has exited brings the full lifecycle perspective from idea to acquisition—and the scar tissue that comes with it.\n\n**Design fluency.** The Product Engineer role sits at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. The instructor should have led UX and design teams, not just collaborated with them. They should understand what makes products feel right, not just function correctly.\n\n**Industry connectivity.** Someone embedded in the startup and venture ecosystem who sees where the industry is heading before it becomes mainstream. Curriculum needs to reflect what employers will want in 2-3 years, not what they wanted when the textbook was written.\n\nIndustry connectivity also means access. The right instructor can bring their network directly into the classroom: founders who just raised Series A, CTOs navigating AI adoption at scale, VCs evaluating the next wave of startups. These are not theoretical conversations. Students hear from practitioners living this shift in real-time. Guest speakers become mentors. Class discussions become recruiting conversations. The instructor's network becomes the students' network. This transforms a course from content delivery into a bridge between McCormick and the companies students want to join.\n\n**Teaching experience.** Someone who has already taught at the graduate level across engineering and business schools, and who has trained corporate teams from entry-level to executive.\n\nThis combination is rare.

I am not a manager who \"used to code.\" I write production systems daily:\n\n-   **MCP Servers & Multi-Agent Orchestration:** I build and publish **Model Context Protocol servers** to npm, enabling AI agents to connect with external services. I build multi-agent systems using **LangChain, n8n**, and **ReAct frameworks** that coordinate across foundational models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere). I have built systems that stream real-time meeting transcripts via **Websockets** and **Assembly AI**, enabling agents to act during live calls.\n\n-   **Full-Stack AI Infrastructure:** I work across the modern AI stack: **vector databases (PGVector)**, **semantic search with embeddings**, **full-text search (BM25)**, **Cohere reranking**, **Agentic RAG pipelines**, and **LLM chaining with reflection loops**. I build in **React/TypeScript** with **serverless APIs** and integrate tools like **Firecrawl** and **Tavily** for deep research agents. I have built **browser automation agents**, content graders with scoring rubrics, and custom HTML email generation systems.\n\n-   **Live Multimodal AI:** I build systems that process voice, text, and images in real-time, connecting AI agents to device hardware and sensor data.\n\n-   **Synthetic User Platforms:** I built a synthetic user system that simulates customer feedback using LLM-generated personas. The platform uses **graph databases and knowledge graphs** to model user relationships and context, with **self-learning loops** that refine persona accuracy based on research validation. This is an example of the new AI workflows reshaping product development.\n\n-   **Agentic Procedural Memory:** I designed and built an **Agentic Procedural Memory System** that enables AI agents to learn from their own experiences. The system detects failure-to-success patterns in tool usage, performs automated root cause analysis, and stores reusable procedures in a **hybrid search architecture** (vector embeddings + BM25 full-text search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion). Agents using this system show **50% step reduction** and **95%+ success rates** on similar tasks. This work builds directly on recent research from Zhejiang University and Alibaba. [17]\n\n-   **Client Work & Executive Advisory:** I consult directly with public company CTOs and CEOs on AI strategy, and run hands-on design workshops with their development teams. This means reviewing AI proposals, debugging architectures, and pairing with senior engineers to ship production code. I build alongside the teams I teach.\n\n-   **Corporate Training:** Through my consulting firm, I run a **12-week curriculum** that upskills engineers, product managers, and designers into proficient AI practitioners. Participants leave implementing AI into their products and operations. My workshops span entry-level engineers to product directors.\n\n-   **Published Research:** I publish original technical research on AI agent architectures. A recent investigation reverse-engineered Claude Code's API requests and identified an implementation flaw: skill instructions were being injected as user messages (low authority) rather than in the system prompt (high authority), explaining why Vercel's benchmarks showed only 53% pass rates. [23] This kind of deep technical analysis is what I bring to both clients and students.\n\n-   **Open Source:** I maintain 13 public repositories on GitHub (github.com/jrenaldi79), including MCP servers, agent frameworks, and prompt engineering collections."

Writing CLAUDE.md files and AGENTS.md specifications that give AI agents the context they need. Prompt engineering that produces consistent, testable outputs.\n\n-   **Infrastructure Requirements:** Rate limiting, API gateway management, cost tracking, latency budgets. How to build systems that gracefully degrade when AI services fail. Caching strategies for expensive model calls.\n\n-   **Operational Changes:** AI development requires different workflows than traditional software. Students learn: how to review AI-generated code, when to trust agent outputs vs. verify them, how to debug systems where the logic is partially opaque.\n\n-   **Planning Tool Integration:** Connecting agents to project management systems (Linear, Jira, Asana), documentation platforms, and CI/CD pipelines. Building agents that understand your codebase through proper indexing and retrieval.\n\n-   **Agent Swarms & Orchestration:** When single agents are not enough, you coordinate multiple specialized agents that divide work, share context, and merge results. Handoff protocols, conflict resolution, and resource allocation.\n\n-   **Memory Systems:** Building procedural memory so agents learn from past interactions.

Session management, state persistence, and graceful recovery from interruptions.\n\n-   **Deep Agents:** Building agents that can explore complex domains: reading documentation, navigating codebases, researching across multiple sources. These agents need strategies for prioritizing information and knowing when to stop.\n\n-   **Context Window Management:** Summarization strategies, dynamic context loading, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that pulls relevant information on demand rather than stuffing everything into the prompt.\n\n-   **Hierarchical Context:** Some information is always relevant (system instructions, core identity). Some is session-specific. Some is task-specific. Students learn to structure context in layers that maximize utility while minimizing token waste.\n\n-   **Tool Design for Context:** Building MCP servers and tool interfaces that provide rich context to agents without overwhelming them.

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>Dean Schuh has called for "whole-brain" engineering that pairs technical depth with innovation, design, and entrepreneurial thinking. The Product Engineer curriculum embodies this integration. Students learn to move fluidly between user research, technical implementation, and business strategy. They do not just build systems; they understand why those systems matter and who they serve.</RichText>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>**Executive credibility.** Someone who has led teams at scale across design, product, and engineering, and understands how decisions get made in large organizations. Students need to learn not just how to build, but how to navigate the systems that ship products.</RichText>
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>**Hands-on builder.** Not someone who "used to code." Someone who builds production AI systems today. The tools are changing too fast for secondhand knowledge. Students need an instructor who has shipped MCP servers, built agentic systems, and debugged LLM pipelines this month.</RichText>
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>**Startup experience.** Someone who has founded a company, raised capital, and exited. Entrepreneurship cannot be taught from case studies alone.</RichText>
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>This matters more now than ever. AI has collapsed the cost of building, but not the hard parts: figuring out what to build, finding customers who will pay, navigating ambiguity with limited resources. Founders learn these skills through survival. In an era where anyone can prompt an AI to generate code, the differentiating skills are exactly what founders develop: judgment about what's worth building, speed of iteration, and the ability to operate when the path is unclear. A founder who has exited brings the full lifecycle perspective from idea to acquisition—and the scar tissue that comes with it.</RichText>
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>**Design fluency.** The Product Engineer role sits at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. The instructor should have led UX and design teams, not just collaborated with them. They should understand what makes products feel right, not just function correctly.</RichText>
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>**Industry connectivity.** Someone embedded in the startup and venture ecosystem who sees where the industry is heading before it becomes mainstream. Curriculum needs to reflect what employers will want in 2-3 years, not what they wanted when the textbook was written.</RichText>
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>Industry connectivity also means access. The right instructor can bring their network directly into the classroom: founders who just raised Series A, CTOs navigating AI adoption at scale, VCs evaluating the next wave of startups. These are not theoretical conversations. Students hear from practitioners living this shift in real-time. Guest speakers become mentors. Class discussions become recruiting conversations. The instructor's network becomes the students' network. This transforms a course from content delivery into a bridge between McCormick and the companies students want to join.</RichText>

          <Paragraph>
            <RichText>This combination is rare. Most executives do not build. Most builders have not led at scale. Most founders have not taught.
