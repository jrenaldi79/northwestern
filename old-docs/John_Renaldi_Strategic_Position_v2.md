## The Case for Practical, Hands-On Engineering Education

### What Industry Demands

The most valuable engineers today are not specialists in isolation—they are integrators who can:

- Move fluidly between code, design, and business strategy
- Build functional prototypes rapidly, not just theoretical models
- Apply AI as a practical tool, not an abstract concept
- Ship products that customers actually use

### John's Unique Qualification

John has done all of this—repeatedly, at scale, with measurable outcomes:

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **Building at Scale** | Led global wearable software at Google (design, product, research) |
| **Startup Execution** | Founded Jiobit → acquired by Life360 for **$37M** (up to **$54.5M** with earnout) |
| **Hardware + Software** | Created Moto Maker/Moto X—first built-to-order D2C smartphone |
| **Technical Depth** | Self-taught developer who architected sensor fusion systems **trusted by federal government and law enforcement** |
| **Product Leadership** | Products recognized by Wired, CES, Webby Awards, Red Dot Design Award |

## Engineering Credentials That Matter

### The Moto Maker Story: Where Behavioral Science Meets Manufacturing

At Motorola, John didn't just manage—he built. He created the **first direct-to-consumer, built-to-order smartphone business** in the industry. But what makes this relevant to an engineering school is *how* he did it.

John applied academic research to solve real engineering problems:

> "There's a concept called the Ikea effect. The Harvard Business Review put it out. And the Ikea effect says that if you have a hand in creating something, your affinity for that product goes through the roof."

When early versions of Moto Maker offered too many choices, John applied research on the "Paradox of Choice" to redesign the system:

> "By curating these colors, we saw that anxiety go away, and we saw them actually click around more and try out different combinations."

This isn't just product intuition—it's the scientific method applied to user experience. The result: a system that shipped **custom phones in 4 days or less** from order to delivery, requiring:

- Real-time manufacturing integration at the Fort Worth plant
- Supply chain engineering for 2,000+ product permutations
- Software systems connecting customer choices to production lines
- Quality control across millions of unique configurations

This is engineering in its truest sense: solving hard technical problems under real-world constraints with paying customers.

### The Jiobit Technical Challenge: Engineering Trusted by the Federal Government

When John founded Jiobit, he tackled a problem most engineers would avoid: building the smallest, longest-lasting GPS tracker for children. This required:

- **Custom system architecture** designed from scratch
- **Sensor fusion technology** combining GPS, cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth
- **Hardware miniaturization** achieving industry-leading form factor
- **Battery optimization** that defied existing benchmarks
- **Security engineering** rigorous enough for federal trust

The result wasn't just a successful consumer product—it was technology **trusted by federal government customers and law enforcement** for sensitive location tracking. This level of security clearance speaks to engineering rigor that goes far beyond typical startup work.

The market validated the engineering: Life360 acquired Jiobit for **$37 million upfront, with earnouts up to $54.5 million**, citing triple-digit growth rates and technology they couldn't replicate internally.

**Perhaps most telling: all 25 Jiobit employees joined Life360 after the acquisition**—a testament to the team and culture John built.

## The Non-Traditional Path as a Teaching Model

Here's something counterintuitive that may resonate with an MIT mindset: **John doesn't have a traditional engineering degree.**

He holds a BS in Marketing from Illinois. He's a self-taught software developer. And yet he:

- Architected sensor fusion systems trusted by federal agencies
- Built manufacturing-integrated software at Motorola
- Led engineering, design, and product teams at Google
- Created technology that sold for tens of millions of dollars

This isn't a weakness—it's a teaching philosophy in action. John models exactly what we want students to become: **someone who doesn't wait for credentials but acquires skills to solve real problems.**

In a world where AI is democratizing technical capabilities, the ability to learn rapidly and apply knowledge practically matters more than pedigree. John embodies this, and he can teach it.

## The AI Curriculum Opportunity

### Why This Matters Now

Every knowledge worker's job is being transformed by AI. The question is no longer *whether* to integrate AI into product development—it's *how*. Students need faculty who are doing this work today, not studying it from a distance.

### John's Current AI Practice

John isn't theorizing about AI—he's shipping AI products:

- **At Google**: Leading wearable software integrating AI for health platforms
- **In Consulting**: Helping companies solve AI engineering challenges
- **Building**: Creating AI applications for clients across industries
- **Teaching**: Already instructing MMM and MPD students on applied AI

### Proposed Curriculum Expansion

John can develop and teach courses that don't currently exist at Northwestern:

1. **AI-Augmented Product Development**
   - Using AI tools throughout the product lifecycle
   - Prompt engineering for product managers and designers
   - Building AI features into physical and digital products

2. **From Concept to Ship: Hands-On Product Engineering**
   - Rapid prototyping with modern tools
   - Hardware-software integration
   - D2C product strategies and execution

3. **The Product Trifecta: Design, Engineering, and Business**
   - Cross-functional leadership
   - Building "missionaries, not mercenaries"
   - Outcome-focused product organizations

## Recommendation

John Renaldi is not a typical academic hire. He's a proven builder whose technology has been trusted by federal agencies, a successful entrepreneur who created $54.5M in acquisition value, and a current tech executive who has chosen to invest his time in education.

The question isn't whether John has the credentials—the federal government, Life360's board, and Google have already validated that. The question is whether Northwestern is ready to embrace a new model of faculty: one who brings tomorrow's skills into today's classroom.

**The future of product development is AI-augmented, cross-functional, and hands-on. John Renaldi has been living that future. It's time for Northwestern students to learn from someone who's building it.**
