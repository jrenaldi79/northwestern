PROPOSAL FOR CLINICAL FACULTY APPOINTMENT
=========================================

**TO:** Julio M. Ottino, Dean, McCormick School of Engineering

**FROM:** John Renaldi

**SUBJECT:** Addressing the Market Shift: The "Product Engineer" Curriculum

1. The Market & Student Need
----------------------------

The entry-level engineering market is undergoing a structural disruption. As Generative AI commoditizes code generation, the value of an engineer is shifting from **syntax proficiency** to **system orchestration**.

Data from industry and academia alike indicates a widening gap between traditional engineering graduates and the needs of modern technical organizations.

### The Rise of the "Product Engineer"

Leading technology companies are redefining their technical roles. As Marty Cagan (SVPG) argues, **"The single most important thing... is empowered engineers."** Innovation happens when engineers are equipped with business context.

-   **Industry Shift:** Companies like **Vercel** and **Linear** are actively hiring "Product Engineers"—builders who "care more about outcomes and impact than the exact implementation."

-   **The Salary Signal:** This is a premium skillset; entry-level Product Engineer roles in major hubs now command salaries upwards of $196k, signaling high market demand.

### The AI Productivity Cliff

The traditional "Junior Developer" role is disappearing.

-   **Adoption:** **84% of developers** now use AI tools (Stack Overflow 2025).

-   **Impact:** GitHub research shows developers using AI complete tasks **55.8% faster**, while McKinsey reports up to **45% improvements in software quality**.

-   **The Academic Response:** Leaders like Magdalena Balazinska (UW Allen School) are blunt: *"Coding, or the translation of a precise design into software instructions, is dead. AI can do that."*

**The Opportunity:** Employers now prioritize **problem-solving (~90%)** over GPA. McCormick has the opportunity to formalize a track that produces this new archetype: The Full-Cycle Product Engineer who is "Day 1 Ready."

2. The Solution: A "Full-Cycle" Curriculum
------------------------------------------

To address this need, I propose a skills-based curriculum focused on **"Ideation to Delivery."** This is an operational bootcamp where students function as a one-person engineering team. I am already piloting elements of this curriculum, integrating tools like **n8n** for workflow automation into my current classes.

### Module A: Quantitative Discovery (The "Why")

-   **Objective:** Replace intuition with data-driven engineering.

-   **Curriculum:** Translating qualitative *Jobs to be Done (JTBD)* into quantitative datasets. Using **Python (Scikit-learn/Pandas)** to execute unsupervised clustering algorithms on market data.

### Module B: Generative Architecture (The "What")

-   **Objective:** Rapid translation of requirements to blueprint.

-   **Curriculum:** Using Agentic tools to generate high-fidelity wireframes from "back of napkin" sketches.

-   **Synthetic User Modeling:** Architecting LLM-based personas to simulate user feedback loops, allowing students to "test" products against AI agents before writing production code.

### Module C: Agentic Software Engineering (The "How")

-   **Objective:** Moving beyond chatbots to engineering autonomous systems.

-   **Curriculum:**

    -   **Emerging Standards:** Implementation of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers to standardize agent connectivity.

    -   **Memory Systems:** Architecting vector-based memory (Episodic vs. Semantic) so agents maintain state. *Note: I am currently developing materials that position Agent Skills as procedural memory components.*

    -   **TDD for Agents:** Shifting from manual QA to rigorous "Evals" that test non-deterministic AI outputs against safety guardrails.

### Module D: Infrastructure & Operations (The "Where")

-   **Objective:** Day 1 deployment capability.

-   **Curriculum:**

    -   **Gateway Optimization:** Managing rate limits, cost, and latency using tools like OpenRouter—skills I actively practice in my own development.

    -   **Cloud Provisioning:** Hands-on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** provisioning (IAM, Compute Engine).

### Module E: Venture Dynamics (The "Viability")

-   **Objective:** Understanding the economics of engineering.

-   **Curriculum:** Cap table management, fundraising mechanics, and due diligence preparation. How institutional investors evaluate technical stacks and IP.

3. The Proof: Operational Provenance
------------------------------------

I am uniquely positioned to deliver this curriculum because I bridge the academic, executive, and builder worlds.

### The Modern Practitioner (Current Technical Work)

I am not a manager who "used to code." I have pivoted back to strictly building to stay on the bleeding edge:

-   **Agentic Orchestration:** I built the **"Claude Sidecar System,"** a multi-model subagent tool that spawns parallel conversations with different LLMs and synthesizes results—the exact orchestration skill students need.

-   **Tool Development:** I developed **"Claude Logger"** to intercept system prompts for analysis and the **"AgentSync"** Android app to integrate AI agents with device hardware.

-   **Enterprise Consulting:** My curriculum is stress-tested in the market. I actively consult for **Life360** (my acquirer) and **Newscorp/Realtor.com**, validating that these specific AI skills have immediate enterprise demand.

### The Educator (Institutional Bridge)

-   **Dual Exposure:** I currently teach at both **McCormick (Segal)** and the **Kellogg School of Management**. I already bridge the engineering/business divide institutionally, making me the ideal candidate to formalize the "Product Engineer" track.

### The Builder: Jiobit (0 to 1)

-   **The Catalyst (Engineering Ethics):** I founded Jiobit to solve a security crisis in the tracking market. I architected a device with enterprise-grade encryption—teaching students that **security is an architectural decision.**

-   **The "Hard Tech" Challenge:** We solved massive RF and thermal physics challenges to pack Cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi, and BLE into a cookie-sized device. I hold key patents (**US 9,980,087** & **10,064,002**) on the "Progressive Beaconing" power management system.

-   **The Outcome:** Secured a **$749k SBIR Phase II Award** (Air Force), grew revenue 200% YoY, and exited to **Life360** for **$54.5M**.

### The Architect: Motorola (Intrapreneurship)

-   **The Build:** I architected **Moto Maker**, connecting a consumer website to the factory floor in real-time.

-   **The Results:** Under my leadership as VP of Global eCommerce, we saw **10x YoY growth** and a **50% decrease in product returns**, winning multiple **Webby Awards**.

### The Executive Scaler: Google (Management Rigor)

-   **Multi-Disciplinary Leadership:** I led an organization spanning **Design, UXR, Product, and Engineering (Firmware to Cloud)**. I understand how to take "hackathon code" and refactor it for global scale, reliability, and security.

-   **Enterprise Foundations:** My roots at **Deloitte** building web applications for enterprise clients gave me a foundation in rigorous requirements gathering and client delivery—discipline I bring to curriculum design.

### The Investor: Market Validation

-   **Capital Allocator:** As an investor in **20+ companies**, a **Techstars Selection Committee** member, and a **Limited Partner in 4 Venture Funds**, I know exactly what the market demands.

-   **Midwest Bridge:** As a UIUC alumnus and founding member of **Illini Angels**, I help position McCormick as the primary talent pipeline for the Chicago tech ecosystem.

4. Validated Impact: Stakeholder Feedback
-----------------------------------------

My effectiveness is best reflected by those I have worked with across the ecosystem.

-   **On Innovation & Leadership:** *"John is obsessed with understanding customer needs and can rally great technical talent around solving real user problems... I've seen John balance that successfully again and again."*
    — **Lior Ron**, Founder of Uber Freight, Former Moto/Google Executive

-   **On Market Impact:** *"We've long wanted to expand beyond the smartphone into wearable devices, and Jiobit offers the market leading device for pets, younger children, and seniors."*
    — **Chris Hulls**, CEO of Life360 (upon acquisition)

-   **On Teaching Philosophy:** My current teaching in the **MPD² program** focuses on outcomes over outputs. I teach students to be **"missionaries, not mercenaries,"** a philosophy that is critical for the next generation of AI-enabled engineers.

5. Conclusion
-------------

The "Product Engineer" is the future of our industry. McCormick has the opportunity to lead in defining how this role is taught.

I offer the faculty a rare combination: the executive perspective to understand *why* this shift is happening, and the hands-on coding ability to teach students *how* to execute it. I look forward to discussing how we can operationalize this role.
