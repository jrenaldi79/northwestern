PROPOSAL FOR CLINICAL FACULTY APPOINTMENT
=========================================

**TO:** Julio M. Ottino, Dean, McCormick School of Engineering

**FROM:** John Renaldi

**SUBJECT:** Addressing the Market Shift: The \"Product Engineer\"
Curriculum

1. The Market & Student Need
----------------------------

The entry-level engineering market is undergoing a structural
disruption. As Generative AI commoditizes code generation, the value of
an engineer is shifting from **syntax proficiency** to **system
orchestration**.

Industry data and hiring trends indicate a widening gap between
traditional engineering graduates and the needs of modern technical
organizations:

-   **The Rise of the \"Product Engineer\":** Silicon Valley firms and
    > major enterprises are moving away from siloed \"coders.\" As noted
    > by industry leaders like Marty Cagan (SVPG), high-velocity
    > organizations now prioritize **\"Product Engineers\"**---builders
    > who possess the business context to decide *what* to build, and
    > the AI-augmented technical capacity to build it end-to-end.

-   **The AI \"Junior Developer\" Cliff:** With tools like GitHub
    > Copilot and LLMs handling 40-60% of boilerplate coding, the role
    > of the \"Junior Dev\" is disappearing. Employers now expect
    > entry-level hires to operate with \"Senior\" capabilities:
    > architectural understanding, testing rigor, and deployment
    > autonomy.

-   **The Venture Capital Reality:** As an active investor and Techstars
    > selector, I see firsthand that capital is flowing to founders and
    > engineers who can demonstrate **\"Ideation to Delivery\"**
    > capabilities without needing large, bloated teams.

**The Gap:** Most programs still teach engineering in silos (CS vs. EE
vs. Business). Students are graduating with strong theoretical knowledge
but lack the operational capacity to manage **AI Agent teams**, spin up
cloud infrastructure, or validate market needs mathematically.

**The Opportunity:** McCormick has the opportunity to formalize a track
that produces this new archetype: The Full-Cycle Product Engineer.

2. The Solution: A \"Full-Cycle\" Curriculum
--------------------------------------------

To address this need, I propose a skills-based curriculum focused on
**\"Ideation to Delivery.\"** This is not a theoretical survey of AI. It
is an operational bootcamp where students learn to leverage AI agents,
cloud infrastructure, and ML data pipelines to function as a one-person
engineering team.

### Module A: Quantitative Discovery (The \"Why\")

-   **Objective:** Replace intuition with data-driven engineering.

-   **Curriculum:** \* Translating qualitative *Jobs to be Done (JTBD)*
    > into quantitative datasets.

    -   Using **Python (Scikit-learn/Pandas)** to execute unsupervised
        > clustering algorithms on market data to mathematically
        > identify user segments.

### Module B: Generative Architecture (The \"What\")

-   **Objective:** Rapid translation of requirements to blueprint.

-   **Curriculum:** \* Using Agentic tools to generate high-fidelity
    > wireframes from \"back of napkin\" sketches.

    -   **Synthetic User Modeling:** Architecting LLM-based personas to
        > simulate user feedback loops, allowing students to \"test\"
        > products against AI agents before writing production code.

### Module C: Agentic Software Engineering (The \"How\")

-   **Objective:** moving beyond chatbots to engineering autonomous
    > systems.

-   **Curriculum:** \* **Emerging Standards:** Implementation of **Model
    > Context Protocol (MCP)** servers to standardize agent
    > connectivity.

    -   **Memory Systems:** Architecting vector-based memory (Episodic
        > vs. Semantic) so agents maintain state.

    -   **TDD for Agents:** Shifting from manual QA to rigorous
        > \"Evals\" that test non-deterministic AI outputs against
        > safety guardrails.

### Module D: Infrastructure & Operations (The \"Where\")

-   **Objective:** Day 1 deployment capability.

-   **Curriculum:** \* Hands-on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
    > provisioning: IAM roles, compute instances, and cost management.

    -   Configuring AI Gateways to manage latency and rate limits for
        > production applications.

### Module E: Venture Dynamics (The \"viability\")

-   **Objective:** Understanding the economics of engineering.

-   **Curriculum:** \* Cap table management, fundraising mechanics, and
    > due diligence preparation.

    -   How institutional investors evaluate technical stacks and IP.

3. The Proof: Operational Provenance
------------------------------------

I am uniquely positioned to deliver this curriculum because I have lived
every phase of this cycle---as a builder, an executive scaler, and an
investor.

### The Architect & Builder (Proof of Technical Depth)

-   **Motorola (Moto Maker):** I did not just manage this program; I
    > helped architect the system that connected a consumer frontend
    > (millions of permutations) directly to factory-floor logic. This
    > is the definition of **Systems Engineering**.

-   **Jiobit:** As Founder/CEO, I held the **key patents** on the
    > device's system engineering. I personally wrote the code for the
    > subscription billing platform and automated cellular provisioning
    > systems. I know the friction of \"0-to-1\" because I built the
    > firmware and the cloud logic myself.

-   **Recent Agentic Work:** Over the last two years, I have returned to
    > the code, strictly building end-to-end **Agentic systems** using
    > the latest memory systems and MCP servers. I am teaching the tools
    > I use daily.

### The Executive Scaler (Proof of Management Rigor)

-   **Google:** I led a multi-disciplinary organization spanning Design,
    > UXR, Product, and Engineering (Firmware to Cloud). I understand
    > how to take \"hackathon code\" and refactor it for global scale,
    > reliability, and security.

-   **Deloitte:** My roots are in building web applications for
    > enterprise clients, giving me a foundation in rigorous
    > requirements gathering and client delivery.

### The Investor (Proof of Market Calibration)

-   **Capital Allocator:** As an investor in **20+ companies**, a
    > **Techstars Selection Committee** member, and a Limited Partner in
    > 4 Venture Funds, I know exactly what the market demands from new
    > engineers.

-   **Illini Angels:** As a founding member, I actively evaluate
    > early-stage technical teams, giving me a feedback loop on where
    > recent graduates are failing and succeeding.

4. Validated Impact: Stakeholder Feedback
-----------------------------------------

My effectiveness as a builder, leader, and educator is reflected by
those I have worked with across the ecosystem.

-   **Executive Leadership (Google/Motorola):***\[Insert quote regarding
    > ability to scale complex technical organizations and deliver
    > product innovation.\]*

-   **Engineering Teams & Direct Reports:***\[Insert quote regarding
    > leadership style, technical mentorship, and ability to bridge the
    > gap between management and code.\]*

-   **Students & Workshop Attendees:***\[Insert quote regarding teaching
    > style, ability to simplify complex topics, and practical relevance
    > of curriculum.\]*

-   **Peers & Industry Collaborators:***\[Insert quote regarding
    > reputation as a hands-on builder and innovator.\]*

5. Conclusion
-------------

The \"Product Engineer\" is the future of our industry. McCormick has
the opportunity to lead in defining how this role is taught.

I offer the faculty a rare combination: the executive perspective to
understand *why* this shift is happening, and the hands-on coding
ability to teach students *how* to execute it. I look forward to
discussing how we can operationalize this role.
