      "content": "For decades, software economics worked one way: distributing software cost nearly nothing, but building it required expensive talent. That second part is changing.\n\nAI coding tools have lowered the cost of building software. Product managers can ship features. Designers can prototype in production code. Founders can build an MVP in a weekend. The separation between \"people with ideas\" and \"people who can build\" is shrinking.\n\nThis is happening now, inside the companies building these tools.\n\n### The Anthropic Case Study\n\nAt Anthropic, the company behind Claude, internal research shows [1][2]:\n\n<!-- @stats -->\n<!-- @stat value=\"59%\" label=\"Engineers Using AI Daily\" source=\"up from 28% a year ago\" -->\n<!-- @stat value=\"50%\" label=\"Productivity Gains\" source=\"up from 20% the year before\" -->\n<!-- @stat value=\"90%\" label=\"Code Written by AI\" source=\"Claude Code's own codebase\" -->\n<!-- @stat value=\"10 days\" label=\"To Ship New Products\" source=\"Cowork built with AI tools\" -->\n<!-- /@stats -->\n\nAnthropic now **hires generalists over specialists** because \"many traditional programming skills are less relevant when AI handles implementation details.\" [1]\n\n<!-- @pullquote author=\"Jaana Dogan\" title=\"Principal Engineer, Google\" -->I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour.<!-- /@pullquote -->\n\nMcCormick students will enter this world in 2-3 years. We need to prepare them now.\n\n### The Triad: Design, Product, and Engineering Are Merging\n\nRole boundaries are collapsing. Designers, product managers, and engineers are moving toward each other, and AI tools are accelerating the convergence.\n\n-   **PMs → Engineers:** Six months ago, most product managers shipped zero code. Today, most PMs ship at least one pull request per month. At Anthropic, PMs ship features directly. By end of 2026, PMs may write 10-20% of production code.\n\n-   **Designers → Engineers & PMs:** Designers no longer hand off static mockups. With AI tools, they prototype in production code, make product decisions in real-time, and understand the systems they design for.\n\n-   **Engineers → Product:** When implementation becomes easy, the valuable skill becomes knowing what to build. Engineers who understand customer problems, market dynamics, and business models are worth more than those who only execute specs.\n\n<!-- @convergence -->\n<!-- @role from=\"PMs\" to=\"Engineering\" description=\"Today, most PMs ship at least one pull request per month. At Anthropic, PMs ship features directly.\" -->\n<!-- @role from=\"Designers\" to=\"Eng & PM\" description=\"Designers no longer hand off static mockups. They prototype in production code.\" -->\n<!-- @role from=\"Engineers\" to=\"Product\" description=\"When implementation becomes easy, the valuable skill becomes knowing what to build.\" -->\n<!-- /@convergence -->\n\n<!-- @quotes type=\"carousel\" section=\"triad\" -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Marty Cagan\" title=\"Partner, SVPG\" cite=\"25\" -->\nAnyone actively shaping the product and tackling the product risks is a product creator... With the rise of generative AI-based tools, strong designers and engineers are starting to play this role. This represents a fundamental shift.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Satya Nadella\" title=\"CEO, Microsoft\" cite=\"10\" -->\nLinkedIn combined product manager, designer, frontend and backend engineer roles into a single 'full-stack builder' role.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Guillermo Rauch\" title=\"CEO, Vercel\" -->\nThe best engineers are becoming product engineers. They don't just write code—they understand the customer, the market, and why this feature matters.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Marty Cagan\" title=\"Partner, SVPG\" cite=\"26\" -->\nThe little secret in product is that engineers are typically the best single source of innovation; yet, they are not even invited to the party in this process.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- /@quotes -->\n\nThe tools are converging too. **Claude Code** lets engineers ship features by describing intent. **Figma AI** generates production-ready components from design specs. **Bolt** (which hit $40M ARR in five months [14]) and **Lovable** let anyone describe a feature and watch it appear. These tools do not replace judgment; they automate the translation layer between idea and implementation. The role that remains is the one who knows what to build and why.\n\n| Traditional Workflow | AI-Augmented Workflow |\n|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Designer creates mockups → hands off to engineer | Designer prototypes in production code directly |\n| PM writes specs → waits for implementation | PM ships features, describes intent to AI |\n| Engineer translates requirements to code | Engineer orchestrates AI agents, focuses on architecture |\n| Research takes weeks (recruiting, interviews, analysis) | AI extracts themes in minutes from transcripts |\n| Prototyping requires coding skills | Anyone can describe and generate working prototypes |\n\n**Synthetic users** represent another shift: AI personas that simulate customer feedback before a single line of code is written. Product teams can now test positioning, validate assumptions, and iterate on concepts using LLM-generated personas trained on real research data. This changes the research-to-build cycle entirely.\n\n### The Rise of the \"Product Engineer\"\n\nTech companies are redefining roles around this reality. When implementation becomes easy, companies want engineers who understand why they're building, not just how. This has created a new role that didn't exist five years ago: the **Product Engineer**.\n\nThe Product Engineer sits at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. As one job posting puts it, they *\"care more about outcomes and impact than the exact implementation, or the tools used to solve the problem.\"* They talk directly with customers, analyze usage data, identify which problems are worth solving, and then build the solution themselves. No handoffs. No waiting for specs. The same person who understands the user problem writes the code to solve it.\n\n**Linear**, the project management tool that's become a cult favorite among developers, operates almost entirely with Product Engineers. The company has no dedicated PM roles for most teams. As co-founder Tuomas Artman explains: *\"Instead of having a PM for every team or area of the product, we like to see that the broader team collectively thinks about the product.\"* The result is a tool that ships fast and feels like it was built by people who actually use it, because it was.\n\n**Vercel**, **PostHog**, **incident.io**, **Ghost**, **Ashby**, and **Fly.io** have all adopted similar models. **Shopify** and **Atlassian** have been developing Product Engineers for five years. **Microsoft** is now hiring Product Engineers for Copilot. This is not a startup trend—it's becoming standard practice at scale.\n\nThe compensation signals market demand. Senior Product Engineers command **$147,000-$180,000+**, with Google Trends showing **89% growth** in \"Product Engineer\" searches since 2021.\n\nWhy is this happening now? Three forces are converging. First, AI tools let engineers move faster, freeing time for product thinking. Second, companies are de-specializing, moving away from bloated headcounts and communication overhead. Third, as one analysis puts it: *\"In many ways this is a return to the original ideas of Agile and a counter movement to the increased specialism and bloat of product and technology roles over the last 20 years.\"*\n\nRaquel Smith, a Product Engineer at PostHog, captures the appeal: *\"I've had more fun as a product engineer than in any other role, hands down.\"*\n\n---"

      "title": "The Talent Crisis: Why Traditional Training Fails",
      "content": "The opportunity is clear. But there's a problem: the traditional path into engineering is breaking down just as the role is being redefined.\n\n### The Junior Developer Role Is Disappearing\n\nAs AI makes senior engineers more productive, it's eliminating the entry points where new engineers used to learn their craft.\n\n<!-- @pullquote author=\"Malte Ubl\" title=\"CTO, Vercel\" -->The cost of software production is trending towards zero.<!-- /@pullquote -->\n\nThe numbers are clear. **Stanford's Digital Economy Lab** found entry-level tech job postings dropped **67%** between 2023 and 2024. The **15 biggest tech firms** cut junior hiring by **25%** in the same period. The **Bureau of Labor Statistics** reports programmer employment declined **27.5%** from 2023-2025. CS graduate unemployment has hit **6.1%**, nearly double the national average. [27][28]\n\nThis isn't cyclical. It's structural.\n\nAnthropic CEO **Dario Amodei** forecasts that *\"AI could wipe out up to 50% of all entry-level jobs\"* as the technology improves. SignalFire partner **Heather Doshay** summarizes bluntly: *\"AI is doing what interns and new grads used to do.\"*\n\nThe work that used to train junior developers is now automated. GitHub Copilot users complete repetitive tasks **55% faster**. CRUD operations, boilerplate code, unit tests, documentation, and routine bug fixes, the apprenticeship work that once trained new engineers, is increasingly AI-generated. A ServiceNow/Pearson study found that **26% of tasks performed by junior application developers will be augmented or fully automated by 2027**. [28]\n\nThis creates a structural problem. Junior developers used to learn by doing grunt work: writing boilerplate, fixing bugs, building CRUD applications. That two-year apprenticeship is disappearing. As one developer put it: *\"We're the first generation who have to be Seniors before we're allowed to be Juniors.\"*\n\nKelly Services analyst **Hugo Malan** calls this *\"a tectonic shift... the biggest impact by far would be on programmers.\"*\n\nThe industry is creating a talent pipeline problem that will hit in 2029-2031 when mass senior retirements meet the shortage of developers who were never hired in the first place. As an AWS executive noted: *\"If you don't hire junior developers, you'll someday never have senior developers.\"*\n\nAs Magdalena Balazinska of UW's Allen School puts it: *\"Coding, or the translation of a precise design into software instructions, is dead. AI can do that.\"* [11] The question is: what replaces it?\n\n### The New Skills: What Industry Leaders Are Saying\n\nThe people building AI tools are rethinking what it means to be a developer. Their perspective matters because they see the shift before the rest of the industry.\n\n<!-- @quotes type=\"carousel\" section=\"skills\" -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Ethan Mollick\" title=\"Wharton, Co-Intelligence\" cite=\"7\" -->\nAI skills are basically the skills of good managers: delegation, clear explanations, getting a sense of individual strengths & weaknesses, division of labor, project management, clear feedback.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Andrej Karpathy\" title=\"OpenAI co-founder, former Tesla AI\" cite=\"8\" -->\nI've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored... There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Jensen Huang\" title=\"NVIDIA CEO\" cite=\"9\" -->\nThere's a new programming language. It's called 'human.'\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- @quote author=\"Magdalena Balazinska\" title=\"UW Allen School\" cite=\"11\" -->\nCoding, or the translation of a precise design into software instructions, is dead. AI can do that.\n<!-- /@quote -->\n<!-- /@quotes -->\n\nIndustry leaders agree on what matters now. **Ethan Mollick** (Wharton) argues that *\"AI skills are basically the skills of good managers: delegation, clear explanations, getting a sense of individual strengths & weaknesses, division of labor, project management, clear feedback.\"* [7]\n\n**Andrej Karpathy** (OpenAI co-founder) describes the shift: *\"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored... There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills.\"* [8]\n\nThe programming language itself is changing. As **Jensen Huang** (NVIDIA CEO) puts it: *\"There's a new programming language. It's called 'human.'\"* [9] The numbers confirm this: **20-30% of Microsoft's code** is now AI-written [10], and **Mark Zuckerberg** predicts half of Meta's development will be done by AI within a year.\n\nSkills are shifting: from writing code to orchestrating systems, from syntax to judgment, from execution to strategy. These are the skills we must teach.\n\n<!-- @chart type=\"hierarchy\" title=\"The Skills Shift\" subtitle=\"What matters now vs. what mattered before\" -->\n<!-- @level from=\"Writing Code\" to=\"Orchestrating Systems\" -->\n<!-- @level from=\"Syntax\" to=\"Judgment\" -->\n<!-- @level from=\"Execution\" to=\"Strategy\" -->\n<!-- /@chart -->\n\n**The Opportunity:** Employers now prioritize **problem-solving (~90%)** over GPA.

This role combines technical fluency with product judgment, user empathy, and business context. Companies are hiring for it now, and McCormick can prepare students to fill it.\n\nBut teaching this role requires a specific kind of faculty member, and a curriculum that doesn't yet exist in most engineering schools. The sections that follow lay out how McCormick can lead in defining this curriculum, why John is positioned to teach it, and what students will learn.\n\n---"

This curriculum advances AI as both method and application domain.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- /@cards -->\n\n### Pillar 1: Revolutionize the Methods of Engineering\n\nAI-augmented development is becoming the default method for how engineers work. Context engineering, agentic systems, and production AI workflows are the tools engineers will use across every discipline. This curriculum teaches those methods before they become standard.\n\nThe shift is comparable to when CAD replaced drafting tables or when simulation replaced physical prototyping. Engineers who master AI-augmented methods will define the next generation of engineering practice. McCormick can lead in codifying these methods rather than adopting them later.\n\n<!-- @pullquote -->The shift is analogous to when CAD replaced drafting tables or when simulation replaced physical prototyping.<!-- /@pullquote -->\n\n### Pillar 2: Transform Engineering Education\n\nDean Schuh has called for \"whole-brain\" engineering that pairs technical depth with innovation, design, and entrepreneurial thinking. The Product Engineer curriculum embodies this integration. Students learn to move between user research, technical implementation, and business strategy. They do not just build systems; they understand why those systems matter and who they serve.\n\nThis prepares engineers to function as what Dean Schuh describes as \"the fulcrum between the research lab and the marketplace.\" The marketplace represents humanity and its needs. Engineers serve as the bridge. This curriculum teaches students to be that bridge.\n\n### Pillar 3: Advance Critical Applications of Engineering\n\nAI is explicitly one of McCormick's four grand challenge focus areas, alongside climate, health, and sustainability. This curriculum directly advances AI as both a method (how engineers work) and an application domain (what engineers build).\n\nThe skills taught here also amplify work in the other three focus areas. Climate researchers use AI agents to process satellite data. Health engineers use LLMs to analyze clinical literature. Sustainability teams use generative tools to model resource flows. The Product Engineer mindset and AI fluency accelerate progress across all four challenges.\n\n### A Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity\n\nDean Schuh has expressed interest in \"once-in-a-generation ideas and goals that can carry us into the future together.\" The transformation of engineering practice by AI qualifies. The window to establish McCormick as a leader in AI-augmented engineering education is now, while methods are still being defined and before competitors codify their own approaches.\n\n---"

      "content": "### The Profile Required\n\nIf McCormick wants to prepare students for the \"Product Engineer\" role, the faculty member teaching it needs a specific profile. This is not a traditional academic hire. It requires someone who works across boundaries that do not usually overlap.\n\n<!-- @cards type=\"profile\" columns=\"3\" section=\"3\" -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"briefcase\" title=\"Executive Credibility\" -->\nSomeone who has led teams at scale across design, product, and engineering, and understands how decisions get made in large organizations.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nStudents need to learn not just how to build, but how to navigate the systems that ship products. An executive who has operated at scale understands the politics, the trade-offs, and the communication patterns that determine whether good ideas survive. This perspective cannot be learned from textbooks; it comes from having made decisions that affected thousands of people and millions of dollars.\n\n**John:** VP/GM at Google and Motorola; led cross-functional teams across design, product, and engineering at scale.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"code\" title=\"Hands-on Builder\" -->\nNot someone who \"used to code.\" Someone who builds production AI systems today.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nThe tools are changing too fast for secondhand knowledge. Students need an instructor who has shipped MCP servers, built agentic systems, and debugged LLM pipelines this month. When a student asks \"how do I handle context windows for long-running agents?\" the answer should come from direct experience, not documentation. The instructor should be able to pair-program with students and review their code at a technical level.\n\n**John:** Ships production AI systems daily; 16 GitHub repos; MCP servers published to npm.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"rocket\" title=\"Startup Experience\" -->\nSomeone who has founded a company, raised capital, and exited.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nEntrepreneurship cannot be taught from case studies alone. AI has collapsed the cost of building, but not the hard parts: figuring out what to build, finding customers who will pay, navigating ambiguity with limited resources. Founders learn these skills through survival. In an era where anyone can prompt an AI to generate code, the differentiating skills are exactly what founders develop: judgment about what's worth building, speed of iteration, and the ability to operate when the path is unclear. A founder who has exited brings the full lifecycle perspective, and the scar tissue that comes with it.\n\n**John:** Founded Jiobit → nine-figure exit to Life360 (NASDAQ: LIF).\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"palette\" title=\"Design Fluency\" -->\nThe instructor should have led UX and design teams, not just collaborated with them.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nThe Product Engineer role sits at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. They should understand what makes products feel right, not just function correctly. This means understanding user research methodologies, information architecture, interaction patterns, and visual design principles. When AI can generate functional code quickly, the human differentiator is taste: knowing what feels right and why.\n\n**John:** Led UX Research and UI/UX Design teams at Google; design-centric product leader at Motorola.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"network\" title=\"Industry Connectivity\" -->\nSomeone embedded in the startup and venture ecosystem who sees where the industry is heading before it becomes mainstream.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nCurriculum needs to reflect what employers will want in 2-3 years, not what they wanted when the textbook was written. Industry connectivity also means access. The right instructor can bring their network directly into the classroom: founders who just raised Series A, CTOs navigating AI adoption at scale, VCs evaluating the next wave of startups. Guest speakers become mentors. Class discussions become recruiting conversations. The instructor's network becomes the students' network. This turns a course into a bridge between McCormick and the companies students want to join.\n\n**John:** Techstars Selection Committee; LP in 4 VC funds; 20+ angel investments.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"graduation\" title=\"Teaching Experience\" -->\nSomeone who has taught at the graduate level across engineering and business schools, and trained corporate teams from entry-level to executive.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nTeaching is a skill that requires deliberate practice. Someone who has taught MBAs understands how to frame technical concepts for strategic decision-makers. Someone who has taught engineers understands how to maintain technical rigor. Someone who has trained corporate teams knows how to adapt content for different experience levels in the same room. This pedagogical range is essential for the Product Engineer curriculum.\n\n**John:** McCormick (MPD²), Kellogg (MMM), UIUC (Applied AI); corporate training from entry-level to executive.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- /@cards -->\n\n### Why John Fits This Profile\n\nJohn is an unusual combination: a former Google executive who still ships code daily, a founder with a nine-figure exit, and a design leader who has led UXR, UI/UX, and engineering teams.

He was instrumental in **major developments for the Wear OS platform**, including significant interface updates to support innovative hardware architectures like the Pixel Watch. He spearheaded **one of the first AI innovation product teams within Google Android** and served as the **original product lead for an internal consumer multi-agent orchestration system** designed for building coding agents. He contributed intellectual property and led product teams developing machine learning algorithms for fitness, power management, and location services.\n\nHe led teams across **Design, UXR, Product, and Engineering (Firmware to Cloud)**. He knows how to take prototype code and scale it globally. His time at **Deloitte** building enterprise web applications gave him discipline in requirements gathering and delivery.\n\n### Jiobit (0 to 1)\n\nJohn founded Jiobit after briefly losing his son in a crowded Chicago park. *\"I believe no parent should experience that panic.\"* The team built a device with encryption strong enough to be **trusted by federal government and law enforcement** for sensitive location tracking—security as an architectural decision.\n\nThe hardware was hard: the team packed Cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi, and BLE into a cookie-sized device. As John told *Inventors Digest*: *\"For any of this to work... we had to nail this custom system architecture and the sensor fusion technology.\"* He is named inventor on **9+ issued U.S. patents** covering location tracking, power management, and machine learning systems.\n\nThe outcome: SBIR Phase II Award (Air Force) [21], 200% YoY revenue growth, sold out in the 2018 holiday season, and acquired by **Life360 (NASDAQ: LIF)** in a deal that appreciated to **nine figures**. All 25 employees joined Life360 after the deal. [18][19]\n\n### Motorola (Research to Practice)\n\nJohn created **Moto Maker**, the first direct-to-consumer, built-to-order smartphone. It connected a website to the factory floor with **2,000+ permutations** shipping in **4 days or less**.\n\nWhen early versions had too many choices, he applied HBR research on the \"Paradox of Choice\" [15] and \"IKEA Effect\" [16]: *\"If you have a hand in creating something, your affinity for that product goes through the roof. Labor creates love.\"* The team curated options, reduced anxiety, and increased engagement. As VP of Global eCommerce, they achieved **10x YoY growth**, **50% fewer product returns**, and won **Webby Awards**, **Best of CES**, and the **Red Dot Design Award**.\n\n---"

      "title": "The Hands-On Work: What John Builds Today",
      "content": "The Product Engineer curriculum cannot be taught from textbooks. The tools change too fast. The only way to teach students how to build with AI is to be actively building with AI, today, this week, this month. Everything in this section represents work John does alongside the teams he teaches. These aren't demos or side projects; they're production systems that inform what he brings to the classroom.\n\n<!-- @terminal title=\"recent-builds.log\" command=\"tail -6\" variant=\"compact\" -->\n- [2026-02] This proposal — built with custom React + MCP pipeline\n- [2026-01] Published mcp-google-calendar to npm registry\n- [2026-01] Shipped procedural memory v2 to Fortune 500 client\n- [2025-12] Reverse-engineered Claude Code API architecture\n- [2025-12] Synthetic user platform reached 95% validation accuracy\n- [2025-11] Live multimodal agent demo for CTO workshop\n<!-- /@terminal -->\n\nJohn's most intensive building has happened after Google. He is not a manager who \"used to code.\" He writes production systems daily:\n\n-   **MCP Servers & Multi-Agent Orchestration:** John builds and publishes **Model Context Protocol servers** to npm, allowing AI agents to connect with external services. He builds multi-agent systems using **LangChain, n8n**, and **ReAct frameworks** that coordinate across foundational models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere). He has built systems that stream real-time meeting transcripts via **Websockets** and **Assembly AI**, allowing agents to act during live calls.\n\n-   **Full-Stack AI Infrastructure:** He works across the modern AI stack: **vector databases (PGVector)**, **semantic search with embeddings**, **full-text search (BM25)**, **Cohere reranking**, **Agentic RAG pipelines**, and **LLM chaining with reflection loops**. He builds in **React/TypeScript** with **serverless APIs** and integrates tools like **Firecrawl** and **Tavily** for research agents. He has built **browser automation agents**, content graders with scoring rubrics, and custom HTML email generation systems.\n\n-   **Live Multimodal AI:** He builds systems that process voice, text, and images in real-time, connecting AI agents to device hardware and sensor data.\n\n-   **Synthetic User Platforms:** John built a synthetic user system that simulates customer feedback using LLM-generated personas. The platform uses **graph databases and knowledge graphs** to model user relationships and context, with **self-learning loops** that refine persona accuracy based on research validation. This is an example of the new AI workflows reshaping product development.\n\n-   **Agentic Procedural Memory:** He designed and built an **Agentic Procedural Memory System** that lets AI agents learn from their own experiences. The system detects failure-to-success patterns in tool usage, performs automated root cause analysis, and stores reusable procedures in a **hybrid search architecture** (vector embeddings + BM25 full-text search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion). Agents using this system show **50% step reduction** and **95%+ success rates** on similar tasks. This work builds directly on recent research from Zhejiang University and Alibaba. [17]\n\n-   **Client Work & Executive Advisory:** John consults directly with public company CTOs and CEOs on AI strategy, and runs hands-on design workshops with their development teams. This means reviewing AI proposals, debugging architectures, and pairing with senior engineers to ship production code. He builds alongside the teams he teaches.\n\n-   **Corporate Training:** Through his consulting firm, he runs a **12-week curriculum** that upskills engineers, product managers, and designers into proficient AI practitioners. Participants leave implementing AI into their products and operations. His workshops span entry-level engineers to product directors.\n\n-   **Published Research:** John publishes original technical research on AI agent architectures. A recent investigation reverse-engineered Claude Code's API requests and identified an implementation flaw: skill instructions were being injected as user messages (low authority) rather than in the system prompt (high authority), explaining why Vercel's benchmarks showed only 53% pass rates. [23] This kind of technical analysis is what he brings to both clients and students.\n\n-   **Open Source:** He maintains 16 public repositories on GitHub (github.com/jrenaldi79), including MCP servers, agent frameworks, and prompt engineering collections.\n\n<!-- @terminal title=\"~/john/stack\" command=\"tree\" variant=\"default\" -->\n- `mcp-servers/` → Model Context Protocol integrations\n- `agents/` → LangChain, n8n, ReAct orchestration\n- `rag-pipeline/` → PGVector + BM25 + Cohere reranking\n- `synthetic-users/` → Graph DB persona simulation\n- `procedural-memory/` → Self-learning agent systems\n- `multimodal/` → Voice, text, image processing\n- `clients/` → Production code with Fortune 500 CTOs\n<!-- /@terminal -->\n\n### Teaching & Academic Leadership\n\nJohn teaches at **McCormick (Segal)**, **Kellogg**, and **University of Illinois** (Applied AI), working across engineering and business at multiple institutions. His courses integrate AI into design thinking and product development, including building custom agents and incorporating synthetic users into research. He led **Northwestern's Business Innovation Lab (Winter 2025)** in partnership with **Google DeepMind** and served as a key panelist at **Kearney's 2024 Executive Panel on AI in Product Design**.\n\nHe works alongside **Jim Wicks** (Segal Design Institute founder) and **Mike Edmonds** (Microsoft) in the classroom. His philosophy in the **MPD² program**: outcomes over outputs. He teaches students to be **\"missionaries, not mercenaries.\"**\n\n### Curriculum-Advancing Work\n\nClinical faculty focus on teaching, not traditional academic research with publication requirements. John's work aligns with this model while still advancing the curriculum in measurable ways.\n\n**Testing new methods:** He pilots AI tools and workflows in real courses and corporate training programs before they become mainstream. His 12-week corporate curriculum has been iterated across multiple cohorts, identifying what works and what does not. This applied testing informs what he brings to McCormick students.\n\n**Developing evaluation frameworks:** His work on agentic procedural memory, synthetic user validation, and Claude Code architecture analysis creates benchmarks and evaluation methods that inform pedagogy. Understanding how AI systems fail is as important as understanding how they succeed.\n\n**Building reusable assets:** The MCP servers, agent frameworks, and prompt engineering collections he maintains on GitHub become teaching resources. Students learn from production code, not toy examples.\n\n**Industry feedback loops:** His consulting work with public company CTOs and startup founders provides continuous signal on what skills employers need. This feedback shapes curriculum in near real-time, not on academic publication timelines.\n\nThis is not traditional research, but it is rigorous, iterative work that directly improves teaching effectiveness.\n\n### Industry Visibility\n\nJohn's investing and ecosystem work give him a vantage point: he sees where the industry is heading **8 to 16 months before it becomes mainstream**. That foresight shapes his curriculum. As a UIUC alumnus and founding member of **Illini Angels**, he can position McCormick as a talent pipeline for Chicago tech.\n\n---"

      "title": "What John Can Teach",
      "content": "The Product Engineer needs to move from idea to shipped product. This is not a single course. It is a set of capabilities that can be integrated into existing McCormick and Segal curriculum wherever they fit. John is already piloting parts of this in his current classes.\n\n<!-- @cards type=\"topic\" columns=\"3\" section=\"4\" -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"search\" title=\"Discovery\" audience=\"All engineering disciplines\" -->\nInterview analysis, theme extraction, research synthesis. Turn qualitative research into quantitative datasets.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nTraditional user research takes weeks: recruiting participants, scheduling interviews, transcribing conversations, coding themes. AI compresses this timeline while expanding depth.\n\nStudents learn to use AI as a research amplifier: real-time transcription during interviews, theme extraction across dozens of transcripts, pattern recognition across disparate data sources. The goal is not to replace human judgment but to multiply researcher capacity. An interview that once took days to analyze now yields insights in minutes.\n\n**What John Teaches:** Interview analysis pipelines, theme extraction prompts, cross-source pattern matching, building research repositories that agents can query, integrating voice transcription into live research sessions. Replace intuition with data. Turn qualitative *Jobs to be Done (JTBD)* research into quantitative datasets.\n\n**Technologies:** Assembly AI, Whisper, LLM-based theme extraction, embedding-based similarity search, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, clustering algorithms\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"palette\" title=\"Generative Prototyping\" audience=\"Product-focused engineers, designers\" -->\nSynthetic users, rapid validation, LLM personas. Test positioning before writing code.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nTurn requirements into testable artifacts quickly. Use AI tools to generate wireframes from rough sketches. Build **synthetic user personas** that simulate customer feedback, allowing students to test positioning and product concepts against LLM-generated personas before writing code.\n\n**What John Teaches:** Building synthetic personas that model real customer segments. Rapid prototyping workflows that generate testable artifacts in hours, not weeks. Validation frameworks that surface weak assumptions early.\n\n**Technologies:** LLM foundational models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), image generation, prompt engineering\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"compass\" title=\"Product Management & Innovation\" audience=\"MPD², MBAs, aspiring PMs\" -->\nStrategy, roadmaps, prioritization. Know what to build and why it matters.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nWhen AI makes building cheap, knowing *what* to build becomes the scarce skill. Product management is the discipline of translating user needs into roadmaps, aligning stakeholders, and shipping outcomes, not outputs. John teaches this in MPD² today.\n\n**What John Teaches:**\n• **Product Strategy:** Vision setting, competitive positioning, and the art of saying no. How to build products that matter, not features that ship.\n• **Innovation Frameworks:** Design thinking, Jobs to be Done (JTBD), lean startup methodology, and when to apply each.\n• **Prioritization:** RICE, MoSCoW, ICE scoring. Building roadmaps that balance user value, business impact, and technical feasibility.\n• **Stakeholder Management:** How to align engineering, design, sales, and executives around a shared vision. The politics of product.\n\n**Frameworks:** Design thinking, JTBD, Lean Startup, RICE/ICE prioritization, OKRs\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"cpu\" title=\"Agentic Systems\" audience=\"CS, software engineers\" -->\nMCP servers, multi-agent orchestration, evals. Build autonomous, goal-directed systems.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nMove beyond chatbots to autonomous, goal-directed systems. Build servers that standardize agent connectivity. Design memory systems so agents maintain state across sessions. Shift from manual QA to **evals** that test AI outputs against safety and quality guardrails.\n\n**What John Teaches:** MCP server architecture. Multi-agent coordination patterns. Building evaluation frameworks that test AI behavior against quality and safety criteria. Memory systems for stateful agents.\n\n**Technologies:** MCP servers, LangChain, ReAct frameworks, vector databases, RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"zap\" title=\"Agentic Development\" audience=\"Practicing engineers\" -->\nProduction workflows, debugging, cost management. From \"vibing\" to shipping real systems.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nThere is a gap between prompting ChatGPT and shipping production AI systems. Most tutorials stop at \"vibing,\" the casual, exploratory prompting that works in demos but fails in production. Students need to learn the harder parts: deterministic behavior, error handling, cost management, and integration with existing systems.\n\n**What John Teaches:**\n• **Development Best Practices:** How to use tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf effectively. Writing CLAUDE.md files and AGENTS.md specifications that give AI agents the context they need.\n• **Infrastructure Requirements:** Rate limiting, API gateway management, cost tracking, latency budgets. Building systems that gracefully degrade when AI services fail.\n• **Operational Changes:** How to review AI-generated code, when to trust agent outputs vs. verify them, how to debug systems where the logic is partially opaque.\n• **Agent Swarms & Orchestration:** Coordinating multiple specialized agents that divide work, share context, and merge results.\n\n**Technologies:** Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, API gateways, CI/CD integration\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"layers\" title=\"Context Engineering\" audience=\"Advanced AI practitioners\" -->\nRAG, memory systems, long-running agents. Manage what information agents access and when.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nAI agents fail when they run out of context. A 200k token window sounds large until your agent needs to understand a codebase, remember a conversation history, and execute a multi-step plan at the same time. Context engineering is the discipline of managing what information agents have access to and when.\n\n**What John Teaches:**\n• **Long-Running Systems:** Agents that operate over hours or days, not single-turn interactions. Session management, state persistence, and graceful recovery.\n• **Deep Agents:** Building agents that can explore complex domains: reading documentation, navigating codebases, researching across multiple sources.\n• **Context Window Management:** Summarization strategies, dynamic context loading, and RAG that pulls relevant information on demand.\n• **Tool Design for Context:** Building MCP servers and tool interfaces that provide rich context without overwhelming agents.\n\n**Technologies:** RAG architectures, context summarization, session state management, hierarchical prompt design\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"database\" title=\"AI Infrastructure\" audience=\"Full-stack engineers\" -->\nDeployment, APIs, real-time systems. Connect AI models to real-world data and hardware.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nDeploy AI systems on day one. Manage API gateways for rate limits, cost, and latency. Connect AI models to real-world data sources and device hardware. These are skills John uses daily with clients and students.\n\n**What John Teaches:** Production deployment patterns. API gateway architecture for AI workloads. Real-time streaming with WebSockets. Multimodal input handling. Cost optimization strategies.\n\n**Technologies:** React/TypeScript, serverless APIs, GCP, Websockets, real-time voice transcription, multimodal streaming\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- @card icon=\"rocket\" title=\"Entrepreneurship & Business Modeling\" audience=\"Founders, MBAs\" -->\nFundraising, business models, venture dynamics. From idea to Techstars to nine-figure exit.\n<!-- @expanded -->\nJohn has lived the full startup arc: from idea to Techstars to product-market fit to nine-figure exit. He teaches this from experience, not textbooks. He teaches business modeling in MPD² today.\n\n**What John brings:** He founded Jiobit, raised venture capital, navigated hardware manufacturing, won SBIR contracts, scaled a team, and sold to a public company. He has sat on both sides of the table—as a founder raising money and as an investor evaluating deals. He serves on the Techstars Selection Committee, mentors at mHUB and iVenture Accelerator, and is an LP in four venture funds including LongJump. He has invested in 20+ companies.\n\n**Topics:** Business model canvas, revenue models, unit economics, pricing strategy. Cap table structures, fundraising mechanics, term sheets, due diligence processes. How investors evaluate technical stacks and IP. When to build vs. buy. How to think about defensibility when AI commoditizes implementation. Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM) and go-to-market strategy.\n<!-- /@card -->\n<!-- /@cards -->\n\n*While the examples above reference software, these skills transfer across engineering disciplines. AI is accelerating PCB design, materials discovery, clinical literature analysis, and structural optimization. The core skills (judgment about what to build, fluency with AI tools, and translation between technical capability and human need) prepare engineers for any field where AI is reshaping practice.*\n\n---"
