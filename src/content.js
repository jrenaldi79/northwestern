By end of 2026, PMs may write 10-20% of production code.\n\n-   **Designers → Engineers & PMs:** Designers no longer hand off static mockups. With AI tools, they prototype in production code, make product decisions in real-time, and understand the systems they design for.\n\n-   **Engineers → Product:** When implementation becomes easy, the valuable skill becomes knowing what to build. Engineers who understand customer problems, market dynamics, and business models are worth more than those who only execute specs.\n\n<!-- @convergence -->\n<!-- @role from=\"PMs\" to=\"Engineering\" description=\"Today, most PMs ship at least one pull request per month.

These tools do not replace judgment. They automate the translation layer between idea and implementation.

Product teams can now test positioning, validate assumptions, and iterate on concepts using LLM-generated personas trained on real research data.

The tools are changing too fast for secondhand knowledge.

Entrepreneurship cannot be taught from case studies alone.\n\nThis matters more now than ever. AI has collapsed the cost of building, but not the hard parts: figuring out what to build, finding customers who will pay, navigating ambiguity with limited resources. Founders learn these skills through survival. In an era where anyone can prompt an AI to generate code, the differentiating skills are exactly what founders develop: judgment about what's worth building, speed of iteration, and the ability to operate when the path is unclear. A founder who has exited brings the full lifecycle perspective from idea to acquisition—and the scar tissue that comes with it.\n\n**Design fluency.** The Product Engineer role sits at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. The instructor should have led UX and design teams, not just collaborated with them. They should understand what makes products feel right, not just function correctly.\n\n**Industry connectivity.** Someone embedded in the startup and venture ecosystem who sees where the industry is heading before it becomes mainstream. Curriculum needs to reflect what employers will want in 2-3 years, not what they wanted when the textbook was written.\n\nIndustry connectivity also means access. The right instructor can bring their network directly into the classroom: founders who just raised Series A, CTOs navigating AI adoption at scale, VCs evaluating the next wave of startups. These are not theoretical conversations. Students hear from practitioners living this shift in real-time. Guest speakers become mentors. Class discussions become recruiting conversations. The instructor's network becomes the students' network. This transforms a course from content delivery into a bridge between McCormick and the companies students want to join.\n\n**Teaching experience.** Someone who has already taught at the graduate level across engineering and business schools, and who has trained corporate teams from entry-level to executive.\n\nThis combination is rare.

I am not a manager who \"used to code.\" I write production systems daily:\n\n-   **MCP Servers & Multi-Agent Orchestration:** I build and publish **Model Context Protocol servers** to npm, enabling AI agents to connect with external services. I build multi-agent systems using **LangChain, n8n**, and **ReAct frameworks** that coordinate across foundational models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere). I have built systems that stream real-time meeting transcripts via **Websockets** and **Assembly AI**, enabling agents to act during live calls.\n\n-   **Full-Stack AI Infrastructure:** I work across the modern AI stack: **vector databases (PGVector)**, **semantic search with embeddings**, **full-text search (BM25)**, **Cohere reranking**, **Agentic RAG pipelines**, and **LLM chaining with reflection loops**. I build in **React/TypeScript** with **serverless APIs** and integrate tools like **Firecrawl** and **Tavily** for deep research agents. I have built **browser automation agents**, content graders with scoring rubrics, and custom HTML email generation systems.\n\n-   **Live Multimodal AI:** I build systems that process voice, text, and images in real-time, connecting AI agents to device hardware and sensor data.\n\n-   **Synthetic User Platforms:** I built a synthetic user system that simulates customer feedback using LLM-generated personas. The platform uses **graph databases and knowledge graphs** to model user relationships and context, with **self-learning loops** that refine persona accuracy based on research validation. This is an example of the new AI workflows reshaping product development.\n\n-   **Agentic Procedural Memory:** I designed and built an **Agentic Procedural Memory System** that enables AI agents to learn from their own experiences. The system detects failure-to-success patterns in tool usage, performs automated root cause analysis, and stores reusable procedures in a **hybrid search architecture** (vector embeddings + BM25 full-text search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion). Agents using this system show **50% step reduction** and **95%+ success rates** on similar tasks. This work builds directly on recent research from Zhejiang University and Alibaba. [17]\n\n-   **Client Work & Executive Advisory:** I consult directly with public company CTOs and CEOs on AI strategy, and run hands-on design workshops with their development teams. This means reviewing AI proposals, debugging architectures, and pairing with senior engineers to ship production code. I build alongside the teams I teach.\n\n-   **Corporate Training:** Through my consulting firm, I run a **12-week curriculum** that upskills engineers, product managers, and designers into proficient AI practitioners. Participants leave implementing AI into their products and operations. My workshops span entry-level engineers to product directors.\n\n-   **Published Research:** I publish original technical research on AI agent architectures. A recent investigation reverse-engineered Claude Code's API requests and identified an implementation flaw: skill instructions were being injected as user messages (low authority) rather than in the system prompt (high authority), explaining why Vercel's benchmarks showed only 53% pass rates. [23] This kind of deep technical analysis is what I bring to both clients and students.\n\n-   **Open Source:** I maintain 13 public repositories on GitHub (github.com/jrenaldi79), including MCP servers, agent frameworks, and prompt engineering collections."

AI collapses this timeline while expanding depth.\n\nStudents learn to use AI as a research amplifier: real-time transcription during interviews, instant theme extraction across dozens of transcripts, pattern recognition across disparate data sources. The goal is not to replace human judgment but to multiply researcher capacity. An interview that once took days to analyze now yields insights in minutes. A corpus of customer support tickets becomes a searchable knowledge base of user pain.\n\n**What I Teach:** Interview analysis pipelines, theme extraction prompts, cross-source pattern matching, building research repositories that agents can query, integrating voice transcription (Assembly AI) into live research sessions\n\n**Technologies:** Assembly AI, Whisper, LLM-based theme extraction, embedding-based similarity search, research corpus management"

Most tutorials stop at \"vibing,\" the casual, exploratory prompting that works in demos but fails in production. Students need to learn the hard parts: deterministic behavior, error handling, cost management, and integration with existing systems.\n\n<!-- @pullquote -->There is a gap between prompting ChatGPT and shipping production AI systems.<!-- /@pullquote -->\n\n**What I Teach:**\n\n-   **Development Best Practices:** How to use tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf effectively. Writing CLAUDE.md files and AGENTS.md specifications that give AI agents the context they need. Prompt engineering that produces consistent, testable outputs.\n\n-   **Infrastructure Requirements:** Rate limiting, API gateway management, cost tracking, latency budgets. How to build systems that gracefully degrade when AI services fail. Caching strategies for expensive model calls.\n\n-   **Operational Changes:** AI development requires different workflows than traditional software. Students learn: how to review AI-generated code, when to trust agent outputs vs. verify them, how to debug systems where the logic is partially opaque.\n\n-   **Planning Tool Integration:** Connecting agents to project management systems (Linear, Jira, Asana), documentation platforms, and CI/CD pipelines. Building agents that understand your codebase through proper indexing and retrieval.\n\n-   **Agent Swarms & Orchestration:** When single agents are not enough, you coordinate multiple specialized agents that divide work, share context, and merge results. Handoff protocols, conflict resolution, and resource allocation.\n\n-   **Memory Systems:** Building procedural memory so agents learn from past interactions. Failure-to-success pattern detection, root cause analysis, and retrieval architectures that surface relevant context at the right time.\n\n**Technologies:** Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, API gateways, CI/CD integration"

A 200k token window sounds large until your agent needs to understand a codebase, remember a conversation history, and execute a multi-step plan simultaneously. Context engineering is the discipline of managing what information agents have access to and when.\n\n**What I Teach:**\n\n-   **Long-Running Systems:** Agents that operate over hours or days, not single-turn interactions. Session management, state persistence, and graceful recovery from interruptions.\n\n-   **Deep Agents:** Building agents that can explore complex domains: reading documentation, navigating codebases, researching across multiple sources. These agents need strategies for prioritizing information and knowing when to stop.\n\n-   **Context Window Management:** Summarization strategies, dynamic context loading, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that pulls relevant information on demand rather than stuffing everything into the prompt.\n\n-   **Hierarchical Context:** Some information is always relevant (system instructions, core identity). Some is session-specific. Some is task-specific. Students learn to structure context in layers that maximize utility while minimizing token waste.\n\n-   **Tool Design for Context:** Building MCP servers and tool interfaces that provide rich context to agents without overwhelming them. Pagination, filtering, and progressive disclosure patterns.\n\n**Technologies:** RAG architectures, context summarization, session state management, hierarchical prompt design"

I have sat on both sides of the table, as a founder raising money and as an investor evaluating deals. I serve on the Techstars Selection Committee, mentor at mHUB (hardtech) and iVenture Accelerator, and am an LP in four venture funds including LongJump (Chicago's most active pre-seed fund). I have invested in 20+ companies.\n\n**Topics:** Cap table structures, fundraising mechanics, term sheets, due diligence processes. How investors evaluate technical stacks and IP. When to build vs. buy. How to think about defensibility when AI commoditizes implementation. How to tell a story that raises money. How to build a company that people want to join and stay at."
